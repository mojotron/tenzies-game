# Tenzies Game

This project is part of [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) React course at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) learning platform. It's great opportunity to practice React skills. My goal is to build it using TDD, I still got problems working with it test first approach.
Tutorial is used as general guide line, everything is build before watching videos. Tutorial is there to see another angle for solving same problem from experienced developer, and to pick up new skills along the way.
