# Tenzies Game

This project is part of [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) React course at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) learning platform. It's great opportunity to practice React skills. My goal is to build it using TDD, I still got problems working with it test first approach.
Tutorial is used as general guide line, everything is build before watching videos. Tutorial is there to see another angle for solving same problem from experienced developer, and to pick up new skills along the way.

## What have I learned

- How sync diff state with use effect.
- Preloading and dynamic image rendering in react.
- Move logic from components to separate modules for independent testing (remove tight coupling).
- How to mock localStorage.

## How did I upgrade project

1. High score board, sorted by roll count and game time.
2. Add unit test and majority of integration tests.
3. Use svg images for dice.
4. Add custom style (not from figma file that goes with project) to match react confetti effect

Big thanks to [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) for awesome teaching style, I learned a lot.
